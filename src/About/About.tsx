        <p>
          I am currently working as a Front-End developer using React Native and
          ReactJs as my main tools. I am a proactive person with great projects,
          capable of working in a team and under pressure. My goal is to
          continue developing in programming, as it has undoubtedly changed the
          course of my professional life. I am currently seeking a new challenge
          to continue growing both technically and personally, and to train in
          new technologies.

    </div>
